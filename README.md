# gmbot-with-boxes
 Real name: Fox vs Plants
 
 Gamemaker project for comparison with engines Unity and Godot.

The first project called Fox vs Plants was developed with Godot. The second was developed with GameMaker and called GMBot with Boxes, but eventually its assets were swapped to be the same as the first project. So the project name is GMBot with Boxes, but it is in fact a Fox vs Plants version made with GameMaker.
